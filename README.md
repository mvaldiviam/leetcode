# LeetCode

Hi there! 
Welcome to my LeetCode repository. 
I will be sharing some code I'm submitting to LeetCode website and challenges. 
I'm making this basically to learn and develop my Programming and Software Skills. 
I'm focusing on only submitting some of the first LeetCode problems on the main programming languages available on the platform. 

Note: 
This is for learning pursposes only, solutions may not be optimal for all cases. 

If you'd like to follow me on LeetCode, go to the following website.
